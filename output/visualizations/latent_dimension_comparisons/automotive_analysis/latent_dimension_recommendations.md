Analysis Date: 2025-06-14 20:57:07

## Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates the effectiveness of different latent dimensions for representing automotive data features including speed, position, acceleration, climate conditions, road infrastructure, and geographic information.

## Methodology

- **Numerical Features**: Evaluated using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-values
- **Categorical Features**: Evaluated using Chi-square test p-values
- **Quality Threshold**: p-value > 0.05 indicates good representation
- **Automotive Categories**: Speed/Velocity, Position, Acceleration, Climate, Road/Infrastructure, Geographic

**Memory for 1M Samples**: ~0.02 GB

### Latent Dimension 3

**Training Success Rate**: 6/6 (100.0%)

**Computational Complexity**: Low
**Real-time Suitability**: Suitable for real-time applications

**Memory per Sample**: ~24 bytes
**Memory for 1M Samples**: ~0.02 GB

## Recommendations by Use Case

### Real-time Autonomous Driving
- **Recommended**: Latent dimensions 2-4
- **Rationale**: Low computational overhead, fast inference
- **Trade-off**: May lose some feature detail

### Offline Analysis and Research
- **Recommended**: Latent dimensions 8-16
- **Rationale**: Better feature preservation, acceptable computational cost
- **Trade-off**: Higher memory and computational requirements

### Comprehensive Feature Modeling
- **Recommended**: Latent dimensions 16-32
- **Rationale**: Maximum feature preservation and representation quality
- **Trade-off**: High computational and memory requirements

### Data Compression and Storage
- **Recommended**: Latent dimensions 2-8
- **Rationale**: Significant dimensionality reduction while preserving key patterns
- **Trade-off**: Information loss in exchange for compression

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Start Small**: Begin with latent dimension 4-8 for initial prototyping
2. **Scale Up**: Increase dimension if feature quality is insufficient
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track both representation quality and computational metrics
4. **Use Automotive Categories**: Focus on categories most relevant to your specific application
5. **Consider Hybrid Approaches**: Use different dimensions for different feature types

## Technical Considerations

- **GPU Memory**: Higher dimensions require more GPU memory for training
- **Training Time**: Scales approximately linearly with latent dimension
- **Inference Speed**: Critical for real-time applications
- **Model Complexity**: Higher dimensions may require regularization to prevent overfitting
- **Feature Engineering**: Some automotive features may benefit from domain-specific preprocessing
